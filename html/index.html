		across <b>[% num_vendors %]</b> retailers.</p>

		<p> To start using the service, try searching for a product or

		<h1>Motivation</h1>

		<p> <em>Price</em><b>Chart</b> is meant to be a consumer
		purchasing tool. It is intended to give the consumer insight
		into retail pricing which they would not normally have.  </p>

		<p> A common practice when purchasing something new is <em>price
			comparison</em>. A consumer decides on a certain product
		they are interested in and then look around for the best deal.
		That is what this service does. It automates <em>price
			comparisons</em>. </p>
		
		<p> This is important because the price difference between
		different retailers for the same product is often hundreds of
		dollars if not more. </p>
